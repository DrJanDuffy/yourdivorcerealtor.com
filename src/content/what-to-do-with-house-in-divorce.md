## Understanding Your Options

When going through divorce, deciding what to do with your house is one of the most important decisions you'll make. You have several options, each with different financial, legal, and emotional implications. This guide explains all your options so you can make informed decisions.

## Option 1: Sell the House and Split Proceeds

### How It Works

Both spouses agree to sell the house, and proceeds are divided according to your agreement or court order. In Nevada, as a community property state, proceeds are typically divided 50/50 unless otherwise specified.

### Pros

- Clean financial break
- Both parties get cash to start fresh
- Eliminates ongoing financial entanglements
- No ongoing mortgage responsibility
- Simplest option when both agree

### Cons

- Requires both spouses to agree
- Both must move out
- May have emotional difficulty letting go
- Market timing may not be ideal

## Option 2: One Spouse Buys Out the Other

### How It Works

One spouse keeps the house by buying out the other spouse's share. This involves calculating the buyout amount (typically half the equity) and refinancing the mortgage to remove the other spouse.

### Pros

- One spouse keeps the home
- Children can stay in same home/school
- Other spouse gets cash for their share
- Clean financial break for removed spouse

### Cons

- Keeping spouse must qualify for refinancing alone
- May need cash-out refinance to pay buyout
- Can be financially challenging
- Requires accurate valuation

## Option 3: Co-Own Temporarily (Bird Nesting)

### How It Works

Both spouses continue to co-own the house temporarily, often to allow children to finish school or wait for better market conditions. Clear agreements about expenses, maintenance, and eventual sale are essential.

### Pros

- Children can stay in same home
- Can wait for better market conditions
- More time to make decisions
- Can delay major life changes

### Cons

- Ongoing financial entanglements
- Both remain responsible for mortgage
- Requires clear agreements to prevent conflicts
- Can delay moving forward
- Market risk while waiting

## Option 4: Refinance to Remove One Spouse

### How It Works

If one spouse keeps the house, they refinance the mortgage to remove the other spouse. This protects the removed spouse's credit and eliminates their liability.

### Pros

- Removed spouse is protected
- Clean financial break
- Keeping spouse has full ownership

### Cons

- Keeping spouse must qualify alone
- May not be possible if income is insufficient
- Refinancing costs involved

## Option 5: Deferred Sale

### How It Works

A deferred sale is an agreement between spouses or a court order to delay selling the family home for a period. This may make sense if you are waiting for the market to improve or if your child is still a minor and you do not want to uproot them from school. If you defer the sale, you must agree in writing on who pays the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and maintenance until the home sells.

### When This Makes Sense

- Waiting for better market conditions
- Child is a minor and staying in the same school matters
- One or both spouses need time to secure new housing

## Option 6: Court-Ordered Sale

### How It Works

If spouses can't agree, the court can order the sale. The court may appoint a neutral real estate agent to handle the transaction.

### When This Happens

- Spouses can't reach agreement
- One spouse refuses to sell
- Financial hardship requires sale
- Court determines sale is in best interests
