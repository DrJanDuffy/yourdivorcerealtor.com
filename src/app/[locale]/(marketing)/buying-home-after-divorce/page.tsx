            Your financial situation after divorce may be different from before. Understanding your new financial reality is essential for successful home buying. Dr. Jan Duffy helps you understand your financial position and navigate the mortgage qualification process.
          </p>

          <h3>Mortgage Qualification</h3>
          <p>
            Qualifying for a mortgage after divorce requires understanding how your income, assets, and debts have changed. Lenders will evaluate your financial situation based on your post-divorce circumstances. Dr. Jan Duffy can help you understand what lenders look for and connect you with mortgage professionals who understand divorce situations. Learn more about

            {' '}
            considerations.
          </p>

          <h3>Down Payment Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            Your down payment may come from property division proceeds, savings, or other sources. Understanding how to structure your down payment and what documentation lenders need is important. Dr. Jan Duffy helps you navigate these considerations and ensures you're prepared for the mortgage process.
          </p>

          <h2>Timing Your Purchase</h2>
          <p>
            Timing your home purchase relative to your divorce proceedings matters. Buying before your divorce is final has different implications than buying after. Dr. Jan Duffy helps you understand these timing considerations and plan accordingly.
          </p>

          <h3>Buying Before Divorce is Final</h3>
          <p>
            If you're buying before your divorce is final, the purchase may be considered marital property depending on your state's laws and your specific circumstances. Dr. Jan Duffy can help you understand these implications and coordinate with your attorney to ensure the purchase supports your overall divorce resolution.
          </p>

          <h3>Buying After Divorce is Final</h3>
          <p>
            Buying after your divorce is final is often simpler from a legal perspective, as the property is clearly yours. However, you may need to wait for property division proceeds or other financial arrangements to be finalized. Dr. Jan Duffy helps you understand these timing considerations and plan your purchase accordingly.
          </p>

          <h2>Finding the Right Property</h2>

          </p>

          <h3>Condos and Townhomes for Downsizing</h3>

          </p>

          <h3>Coordination with Divorce Proceedings</h3>
          <p>
            If you're buying before your divorce is final, coordination with your divorce proceedings is important. Dr. Jan Duffy works with your attorney to ensure the purchase aligns with your divorce case and doesn't complicate property division.
